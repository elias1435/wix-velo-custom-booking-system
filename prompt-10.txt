PROMPT 10 — FINAL UX POLISH
Improve UX:
- If no service selected, show “Please select a service” and keep slots hidden.
- If no date selected, show “Please select a date” and keep slots hidden.
- If getAvailability returns 0 slots, show “No slots available”.
- On booking success, scroll to #thankYouBox.
- Keep #outlookLiveLinkText hidden by default and never delete it.
- Keep #icsButton visible.
- Ensure booked slots always show “Booked” and remain disabled.
