PROMPT 9 — DEBUG / RELIABILITY (TEMP LOGS) FOR BOOKED SLOTS
Add temporary debug logging:
- In backend getAvailability:
  log bookedKeys size and sample slotKeys
- In frontend after availability load:
  log first 5 items returned (label, slotKey, available)
Goal: confirm slotKey formatting matches exactly between booking insert and availability check.
Provide a quick way (comment flag) to turn logs off later.
